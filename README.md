## LeakageDetectionAlgorithmApproximation
#Leakage-Detection-Algorithm approximation project done for the course Deep Learning at DTU

This project is done in the course "Deep Learning" at DTU in the fall of 2019. The project is done for Kr√ºger.

In the Experiments folder are scripts for each model type where they are trained and evaluated. These are used for experimenting.
The Models folder contain the optimal models found by the gridsearch done in gridder.py.
nets.py contains functions to define networks for the gridsearch. Trainers.py contains training loops for the gridsearch.
The notebook is a quick go through of the best performing model.
